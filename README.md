## cljs-todo

A simple do list based on ClojurescriptOne.  I originally wrote this code by 
modifying the existing ClojurescriptOne, but I wanted to pull it out into a
standalone project to get a better sense for how much of the code is specific
to my application.

## Usage

Getting started should work just like [getting started with ClojurescriptOne](http://clojurescriptone.com/getting-started.html)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:calebphillips/cljs-todo.git
cd cljs-todo
lein bootstrap 
lein repl
```
